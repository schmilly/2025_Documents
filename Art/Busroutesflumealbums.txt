Flume Albums/Mixtapes as Perth Bus routes:

Flume - 950
-> GOATed material
-> Got some parts that are *very* popular
-> Probably over used at this point and can generate disliking because of over use

Skin - 995
-> Still very strong
-> Not as popular as first wrok but still has some really good stuff in it
-> Still highly used, despite being overshadowed by more larger route/Albums
-> Again can have over used and can generate disliking because of over use

Hi This is Flume (Mixtape) - Purple Cat bus route
-> Kinda miandering
-> Good stuff in there
-> Overshadowed by more popular work
-> One bit that is popular with Trans people due to a collab (UWA/SOPHIE)
-> Defo got some weirdness to it (QEII Medical center)

Palaces - CBD Cat bus routes
-> Underated
-> Very socialist/left wing coded
-> Got some weird stuff there but still a great ride
-> painfully under appreciated
-> Not as good as previous stuff but expirementalness of it is appreciated
-> Got one weird bit that kinda struggles to fit (Only Fans/Green Route)

Things Don't Always Go the Way You Plan - 999/998
-> Sense of anxiety when expirencing.
-> Got some good parts to it
-> Underated due to weird way of realeasing (Circular Route/Mixtape)
-> Clearly has bit of earlier work aesthetics
-> Probably not best as intro or for long enjoyment, something more to be introduced to later fans

Arrived Anxious, Left Bored - 43
-> Very unique and different
-> Strange name
-> Ends in a strange place (Hillary's Boat ramp/No Other)
-> Probably best seen in context of previous mixtapes/routes
-> Basiclaly unknown outside of fans
