Pamphlet Text:

"G'day, my name is William, I'm a fellow renter here at 222 Hay Street complex and find this rental via records online; Most of the building is Airbnb's so I was suprised there actually were any other renters"
"I'm was hoping to get in touch with some fellow residents and help put names to faces I see around the complex; And build a nice community around here."

"I also am trying to promote the Rental and Housing Union; I've attached a pamphlet to this note if you're interested; But basically they help advocate for renters rights and can help us get a better deal rent from our landlords, as well as helping out if you have any legal issues while renting.

"Even if you aren't interested in RAHU would love to get in touch - my phone Number is 0487178768; and I can be found on facebook under William Schmil."
